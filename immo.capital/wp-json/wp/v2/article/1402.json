Professional investors love residential real estate due to its attractive risk-adjusted returns profile. However, deploying capital at scale is very challenging despite the fact that residential is the largest asset class in the world (\u20ac39trillion in Europe alone). Single units account for 94% of all residential real estate transactions, but as valuing and acquiring thousands of single units has so far been practically impossible, investors were restricted to deploying in the empty market of portfolios and multi-family developments. IMMO has built the technology to source, appraise, and acquire single units at scale, thereby opening up a single unit residential real estate as\u00a0a new investment asset class<strong>.<\/strong><\/p><cite>Hans-Christian Zappel, CEO, IMMO Capital<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More about WEF Technology Pioneers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Economic Forum\u2019s Technology Pioneers are early to growth-stage companies from around the world that are involved in the design, development, and deployment of new technologies and innovations, and are poised to have a significant impact on business and society.
