However, in the US it can also be accessed through public markets (indirect) within REITs or securitised SFR pools<sup>2<\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the single-family market (both rented and owner-occupied) makes up 98% of the residential market in Europe, institutional investors are only accessing about 2% to 3% of the market today \u2014 primarily through MFH and BTR-type investments or through secondary portfolio acquisitions. This presents a huge opportunity, as unlocking this asset class can provide stable, consistent streams of income at higher yields than we\u2019ve been seeing in fixed income markets, while also offering attractive returns that are uncorrelated to equities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why asset allocators are shifting to SFR<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Demand for rental housing has never been higher. In Britain, less than 10% of homes were rented in the mid-1990s, but today the share is closer to one in five. In Germany, the split between owning and renting homes is about 50\/50. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SFR phenomenon has clear economic drivers, especially across Europe where housing supply is unable to keep up with increasing demand and many cities face a large deficit. While it&#8217;s true that homeownership is becoming increasingly unaffordable, some millennials simply <strong>choose to rent<\/strong> as this option offers less maintenance challenges, location mobility and flexibility. At the same time, there is a clear mismatch between renter expectations and what typical landlords can offer, opening up significant opportunity for high-quality, refurbished accommodation in city-centre and commuter locations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The multi-family sector \u2013 essentially purpose-built rental apartments \u2013 has been a relative out-performer for institutional investment in real estate over the past 15 years, but intense competition in Europe has been pushing yields down, with the average prime multi-family yield being compressed by 120 basis points since 2012 to reach a record low of 3.24% in 2020<sup>3<\/sup>. Amplified by evolving residential preferences (people seeking less density, more living space with outdoor access and feeling less inclined to be located near their workplace), investor demand will inevitably shift in support of the single-family market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real estate has always been a flight to safety due to its tangible nature and also used to diversify portfolios, but we are still only just uncovering <strong>major opportunities within residential real estate<\/strong>. Investing in SFR can provide cyclical defensive positioning (less impacted by down cycles), as well as capital preservation for conservative investors looking for alternative ways to deploy capital. We expect SFR to have the highest growth trajectory of all real estate asset classes in the years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How do you create scalable SFR portfolios?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Institutional capital has already placed bets on SFR over the past decade and it has become a well-established asset class in the US. As for Europe, we saw Goldman Sachs buy Thistle BTR property portfolio in early 2021 \u2014 918 units across North-West England<sup>4<\/sup> \u2014 but still 98% of the market remains untapped. Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Institutional SFR investment requires partners, technology and resourcefulness. Building these portfolios is operationally intensive and requires large volumes of data, automation and technological innovation. Some of the challenges investors face include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Identifying the best rentals in prime locations at speed and scale<\/li><li>Purchasing them efficiently to build large portfolios<\/li><li>Ongoing property lettings and management for maximising rental yield and capex over the long term<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These are only some of the reasons why <a href=\"https:\/\/immo.capital\/investment-process\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"22\">investing in SFR requires an end-to-end solution<\/a>, utilising data and implementing efficiencies across the entire value chain. We have built the first technology-led residential real estate platform in Europe, which enables us to address every step in the process \u2014 from sourcing, acquisitions and portfolio management through to lettings and property management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SFR is now a viable and attractive alternative to other real estate investments. Using our tech-enabled platform, it\u2019s now possible to up-cycle existing housing stock, refurbish and create large portfolios of single-family rental homes across Europe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup><em>1<\/em><\/sup><em>Savills Research as at September 2021<\/em><br><sup><em>2<\/em><\/sup><em>CBRE, U.S. single-family build-to-rent housing sector, September 2021<\/em><br><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><sup><em>3<\/em><\/sup><em>Savills, Spotlight: European Multifamily<\/em>, <em>published March 2021<\/em><br><em><sup>4<\/sup>Propertywire: Gatehouse Bank sells property portfolio to Goldman Sachs for \u00a3150m, published January 2021<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is SFR?
